# TO DO (back-end)

This app is written in Nodejs, TypeScript with the Nestjs framework. I provided documentation for the APIs using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
The database is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) which is created and run using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
For deployment I used [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) which is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online.

## How to run the application

First clone the repository, then create a .env file and initialize the variables defined in the .env.example file.
